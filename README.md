Foundation HTML Templates Layouts
-----------------

A set of 8 common use-case-specific layouts for Backdrop CMS.

These layouts are based on the Zurb Foundation 6 starter templates found at <http://foundation.zurb.com/templates.html>

Backdrop CMS allows you to easily specify layouts (design skeletons/wireframes) for a URL on your site (or set of paths to pages).
One use-case you may have for your website is a traditional industry specific design.  You may be looking for a quick way to implement a magazine-style website, or a travel-style website, or a quick prototype to discuss with a client.  These set of layouts seek to provide this.  These layouts are not for out of the box radical, creative design.

These set of layouts provide/rely on the Zurb Foundation 6 grid system, which you can use with any theme.  You may find slightly more compatibility by using a Zurb Foundation based theme.  Put another way, it's really noble to think that downloading and enabling one of these layout with Bartik theme with look exactly like the demo site, but more than likely your website will take the same rough shape as the demo, then you can polish up the details.  Layouts and themes are being developed in BackdropCMS to figure out which responsibility belongs to each one and this layout set may change once we figure the responsibilities out.

You may read about using this layout system here: http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html .
If you are using this layout, you may use these grid classes in your theme's CSS -- .small-2 .large-4 .columns etc...

These layouts do not contain the entire framework to save on download speed, so you cannot try to use any theme, then go copy some CSS classes or Javascript and then *magic!* for all the widgets.

Sliders, custom fonts and other theme features do not come with this theme and you are encouraged to incorporate separate modules for each page feature that you wish to have.

One of the goals of these layouts is to be as semantic HTML and accessible as possible in 2016.

The layouts contained within this set are:

foundation_html_templates_agency -- "Bring your work to the forefront with this sleek template that's perfect for agencies or freelancers."
foundation_html_templates_blog -- "an easy to navigate layout, and versatile sidebar will help you get your blog up and running."
foundation_html_templates_ecommerce -- "You'll appreciate this template's large hero slider area" and block places for small, product content.
foundation_html_templates_magazine -- "perfect for..eye catching content. Your stories are easy to find with large feature blocks."
foundation_html_templates_portfolio -- "Show off your work and highlight what you do with this grid style thumbnail layout."
foundation_html_templates_product  -- "Highlight your new product and educate potential customers with this classic template."
foundation_html_templates_single  -- "This sleek, minimal approach can help your blog stand out by putting content front and center."
foundation_html_templates_travel -- a more complex layout to feature different types of content: sign-up blocks, quotes, big action blocks, etc...
